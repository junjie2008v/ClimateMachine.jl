"""
DG Balance Law Discretizations module.
Attempts to provide a reasonable implementation of a discontinuous Galerkin
method (in weak form) on tensor product quadrilateral (2D) and hexahedral (3D)
elements for balance laws of the form

```math
q_{,t} + Σ_{i=1,...d} F_{i,i} = s
```

where ``q`` is the state vector, ``F`` is the flux function, and ``s`` is the
source function. ``F`` includes both the "inviscid" and "viscous" fluxes. Note
that this is a space only discretization, time must be advanced using some
ordinary differential equations methods; see [`ODESolvers`](@ref).

Much of the notation used in this module follows Hesthaven and Warburton (2008).

!!! note

    We plan to switch to a skew-symmetric formulation (at which time this note
    will be removed)

Constructs a `DGBalanceLaw` spatial discretization type for the physics defined
by `flux!` and `source!`. The computational domain is defined by `grid`. The
number of state variables is defined by `length_state_vector`. The user may also
specify an auxiliary state which will be unpacked by the compute kernel passed
on to the user-defined flux and numerical flux functions. The source function
`source!` is optional.

The flux function is called with data from a degree of freedom (DOF) as
```
flux!(F, Q, V, aux, t)
```
where
- `F` is an `MArray` of size `(dim, length_state_vector)` to be filled (note
  that this is uninitialized so the user must set to zero if is this desired)
- `Q` is the state to evaluate (`MArray`)
- `V` is the viscous state to evaluate (`MArray`)
- `aux` is the user-defined auxiliary state (`MArray`)
- `t` is the current simulation time
Warning: Modifications to `Q` or `aux` may cause side effects and should be
avoided.

The numerical flux function is called with data from two DOFs as
```
numerical_flux!(F, nM, QM, VM, auxM, QP, VP, auxP, t)
```
where
- `F` is an `MArray` of size `(dim, length_state_vector)` to be filled with the
  numerical flux across the face (note that this is uninitialized so user must
  set to zero if is this desired)
- `nM` is the unit outward normal to the face with respect to the minus side
  (`MVector` of length `3`)
- `QM` and `QP` are the minus and plus side states (`MArray`)
- `VM` and `VP` are the minus and plus viscous side states (`MArray`)
- `auxM` and `auxP` are the auxiliary states (`MArray`)
- `t` is the current simulation time
Warning: Modifications to `nM`, `QM`, `auxM`, `QP`, or `auxP` may cause side
effects and should be avoided.

If `grid.topology` has a boundary then the function
`numerical_boundary_flux!` must be specified. This function is called
with the data from the neighbouring DOF as
```
numerical_boundary_flux!(F, nM, QM, VM, auxM, QP, VP, auxP, bctype, t)
```
where
- `F` is an `MArray` of size `(dim, length_state_vector)` to be filled with the
  numerical flux across the face (note that this is uninitialized so user must
  set to zero is this desired)
- `nM` is the unit outward normal to the face with respect to the minus side
  (`MVector` of length `3`)
- `QM` and `QP` are the minus and plus side states (`MArray`)
- `VM` and `VP` are the minus and plus viscous side states (`MArray`)
- `auxM` and `auxP` are the auxiliary states (`MArray`)
- `bctype` is the boundary condition flag for the connected face and element of
   `grid.elemtobndy`
- `t` is the current simulation time
Note: `QP` and `auxP` are filled with values based on degrees of freedom
referenced in `grid.vmapP`; `QP` and `auxP` may be modified by the calling
function.

Warning: Modifications to `nM`, `QM`, or `auxM` may cause side effects and
should be avoided.

If present the source function is called with data from a DOF as
```
source!(S, Q, aux, t)
```
where `S` is an `MVector` of length `length_state_vector` to be filled; other
arguments are the same as `flux!` and the same warning concerning `Q` and `aux`
applies.

When `auxiliary_state_initialization! !== nothing` then this is called on the
auxiliary state (assuming `auxiliary_state_length > 0`) as
```
auxiliary_state_initialization!(aux, x, y, z)
```
where `aux` is an `MArray` to fill with the auxiliary state for a DOF located at
Cartesian coordinate locations `(x, y, z)`; see also
[`grad_auxiliary_state!`](@ref) allows the user to take the gradient of a field
stored in the auxiliary state.

TODO: Add docs for
```

!!! note

    If `(x, y, z)`, or data derived from this such as spherical coordinates, is
    needed in the flux or source the user is responsible to storing this in the
